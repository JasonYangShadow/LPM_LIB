# LPM injected library
![image](https://travis-ci.org/JasonYangShadow/LPM_LIB.svg?branch=master)
This is a library written in pure C.

Use it to monitor system calls on Linux system and log the info to disk file. It is similar to strace except it can be compiled to library and use LD_PRELOAD trick to inject into binary program running stage.

Please enjoy!
